Thesis Title	                        CHATBOT APPLICATION FOR DIAGNOSING AND MITIGATING DEPRESSION

								ABSTRACT
    The current situation has led to an increase in the severity of illnesses, requiring escalated medical intervention. 
However, due to limitations in medical personnel, including access to psychiatrists, some patients believe they can 
self-diagnose and manage their conditions. This belief exacerbates mental health issues significantly. One solution to 
mitigate the severity of the situation is mental health screening to provide timely care and prevent escalation to the point of hospitalization.
	The objective of this project is to develop a chatbot application that can assess or diagnose users' 
levels of depression and provide relief for depression through conversations between users and the chatbot. 
This application is designed to run on smartphones using the Android operating system and developed with Android Studio.
